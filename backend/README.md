# PY-Template (PYT)
A very simple Python general purpose template which is being in development stage right now

# Installation
```bash
python setup.py install
```

# Quick start
### Environment variables for PYT are placed in the file `config/environment.py` and I have made a sample file named ```config/environment.example``` for you to see how it works. You can copy the file and rename it to `environment.py` and then you can change the variables to your own.
```python
import os
from colorama import Back

# Application status
APP_DEBUG = "True"
APP_ENVIRONMENT = "development"

# Database credentials
DATABASE_DRIVER = "mysql"
DATABASE_PREFIX = ""
DATABASE_HOST = "localhost"
DATABASE_NAME = "python"
DATABASE_USER = "root"
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ""
DATABASE_PORT = "3306"

# Mail credentials
MAIL_MAILER = "smtp"
MAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
MAIL_PORT = "587"
MAIL_USERNAME = "null"
MAIL_PASSWORD = "null"
MAIL_ENCRYPTION = "TLS"
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS = "hello@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME = "PY Template"

# API credentials
API_ENDPOINT = "https://example.com/api"

os.environ["DATABASE_DRIVER"]   =   str(DATABASE_DRIVER)
os.environ["DATABASE_PREFIX"]   =   str(DATABASE_PREFIX)
os.environ["DATABASE_HOST"]     =   str(DATABASE_HOST)
os.environ["DATABASE_NAME"]     =   str(DATABASE_NAME)
os.environ["DATABASE_USER"]     =   str(DATABASE_USER)
os.environ["DATABASE_PASSWORD"] =   str(DATABASE_PASSWORD)
os.environ["DATABASE_PORT"]     =   str(DATABASE_PORT)
os.environ["MAIL_MAILER"]       =   str(MAIL_MAILER)
os.environ["MAIL_HOST"]         =   str(MAIL_HOST)
os.environ["MAIL_PORT"]         =   str(MAIL_PORT)
os.environ["MAIL_USERNAME"]     =   str(MAIL_USERNAME)
os.environ["MAIL_PASSWORD"]     =   str(MAIL_PASSWORD)
os.environ["MAIL_ENCRYPTION"]   =   str(MAIL_ENCRYPTION)
os.environ["MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS"] =   str(MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS)
os.environ["MAIL_FROM_NAME"]    =   str(MAIL_FROM_NAME)
os.environ["API_ENDPOINT"]      =   str(API_ENDPOINT)
os.environ["APP_DEBUG"]         =   str(APP_DEBUG)
os.environ["APP_ENVIRONMENT"]   =   str(APP_ENVIRONMENT)

def get_env(name):
    try:
        return os.environ[name]
    except KeyError:
        message = Back.RED + "Expected environment variable '{}' not set.".format(name)
        if is_debug() is True:
            raise Exception(message)
        else:
            exit()


def is_debug():
    return get_env("APP_DEBUG") == "True"

```
# Login process
### Login process has been implemented in this template you can refer to ```config/helpers.py``` to customize your own login process
```python
from getpass import getpass
from app.User import User
from config.helpers import login

username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = getpass("Enter your password: ")
login(model=User, user_name=username, user_password=password)
```

# Register process
### Same thing was implemented for registration process
```python
from getpass import getpass
from app.User import User
from config.helpers import register

username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = getpass("Enter your password: ")
register(model=User, user_name=username, user_password=password)
```

## How does registration works?
The register function takes 3 arguments which are ```model```, ```user_name``` and ```user_password``` so if we want to signin we have to make query to the database, the orm takes care of this step by not using the boring sql syntax's, and it deals with the database in a very simple way

```python
from config.security import hash_password
from config.validator import validate_password, required


def register(model, user_name, user_password):
    try:
        model_class = model.where("name", user_name).first()
        if model_class is None:

            if required(user_name) is True and required(user_password) is True:

                if validate_password(user_password) is True:

                    password = hash_password(user_password)
                    model.create({"name": user_name, "password": password})
                    print("User " + user_name + " created successfully!")

                else:
                    print(
                        "Error Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, "
                        "one lowercase letter, one digit and one symbol.")
            else:
                print("Error Username and password are required.")
        else:
            print("User already exists")

    except AttributeError:
        print("Error! Could not create user")
```

## How does login works?
The login function takes 3 arguments which are ```model```, ```user_name``` and ```user_password``` so if we want to signin we have to make query to the database, the orm takes care of this step by not using the boring sql syntax's, and it deals with the database in a very simple way same as register function
```python
from config.security import verify_password


def login(model, user_name, user_password):
    try:
        model_class = model.where("name", user_name).first()
        name = model_class.name.replace(" ", "")
        password = model_class.password.replace(" ", "")

        if name == user_name and verify_password(password=user_password, hashed_password=password) is True:
            print("Welcome " + model_class.name)
        else:
            print("Wrong password")

    except AttributeError:
        print("These credentials do not match our records.")
```

# Security and validation
## Password hashing
I have used argon2 since it is considered now one of the strongest password hashing algorithms libraries, it is very simple, and it generates random salt for each password which we can avoid human predictable passwords.
```python
from argon2 import PasswordHasher

def hash_password(password):
    try:
        password_hasher = PasswordHasher()
        return password_hasher.hash(password)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Password verification
```python
from argon2 import PasswordHasher

def verify_password(password, hashed_password):
    try:
        password_hasher = PasswordHasher()
        return password_hasher.verify(hashed_password, password)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Password validation
### I have made sure to use the most secure password validation rules which can be found in OWASP, you can add your custom rules in ```config/validator.py``` file
```python
from password_validator import PasswordValidator

def required(data):
    return data != ""


def validate_password(password):
    try:
        validator = PasswordValidator()
        validator.min(8).max(100).has().uppercase().has().lowercase().has().digits().has().symbols() and required(
            password)
        return validator.validate(password)
    except AttributeError:
        return False
```

# Database
### Database configuration can be found in ```config/database.py``` and it can not be changed to another directory
```python
from orm.connections import ConnectionResolver as Connection
from config.environment import get_env

DATABASES = {
    "default": "mysql",
    "mysql": {
        "host":     get_env("DATABASE_HOST"),
        "driver":   get_env("DATABASE_DRIVER"),
        "database": get_env("DATABASE_NAME"),
        "user":     get_env("DATABASE_USER"),
        "password": get_env("DATABASE_PASSWORD"),
        "port":     get_env("DATABASE_PORT"),
        "log_queries": False,
        "strict": True,
        "engine": "InnoDB",
        "options": {

        }
    }
}
DB = Connection().set_connection_details(DATABASES)
```

# Models
### Models can be found in ```app``` directory, and they can not be changed to another directory, you can create your own models by extending the ```Model``` class, and you can use the ```Model``` class to make queries to the database for example:
```python
""" User Model """
from orm.models import Model


class User(Model):
    """User Model"""
    __table__ = 'users'
    __primary_key__ = 'id'
    __fillable__ = ['name', 'email', 'password', 'role']
    __timestamps__ = True
    __hidden__ = ['password', 'role']
```
where: </br>
```__table__``` is the name of the table in the database </br>
```__primary_key__``` is the primary key of the table the default is ```id```</br> 
```__fillable__``` is the columns that can be filled by the user </br> 
```__timestamps__``` is the columns that will be filled automatically by the orm </br> 
```__hidden__``` is the columns that will not be shown to the user </br>
